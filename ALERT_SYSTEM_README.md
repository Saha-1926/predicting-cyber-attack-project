# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Alert Management System

## 🐛 Issue Fixed: Alerts Not Showing in Management Interface

### ❌ Problem
You created an incident/alert but it wasn't showing up in the Alert Management interface.

### ✅ Solution
The issue was that the application was using **hardcoded mock data** instead of persistent storage. I've implemented a proper alert management system using Streamlit's session state.

## 🚀 How to Start the Application

### Method 1: Easy Startup (Recommended)
1. **Double-click** `start_app.bat` (Windows)
2. Wait for the application to start
3. The script will show you WiFi access URLs

### Method 2: Manual Startup
```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd "C:\Users\SAI PRUDHVI\Downloads\Cyber"

# Start with WiFi accessibility
python start_app.py
```

### Method 3: Direct Streamlit
```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd "C:\Users\SAI PRUDHVI\Downloads\Cyber"

# Start Streamlit with WiFi access
streamlit run app.py --server.address 0.0.0.0 --server.port 8501
```

## 📱 WiFi Access Instructions

### To Access from Any Device on the Same WiFi:

1. **Find Your Computer's IP Address:**
   - The startup script will show it automatically
   - Or run: `ipconfig` (Windows) / `ifconfig` (Mac/Linux)

2. **Access from Other Devices:**
   - Phone/Tablet: Open browser → Go to `http://YOUR_IP:8501`
   - Another Computer: Open browser → Go to `http://YOUR_IP:8501`
   - Example: `http://192.168.1.100:8501`

3. **Troubleshooting WiFi Access:**
   - ✅ Ensure all devices are on the **same WiFi network**
   - ✅ Check Windows Firewall settings
   - ✅ Disable VPN temporarily
   - ✅ Try different ports (8502, 8503, etc.)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: "Alert Not Showing"
**Solution:** The new system uses session state. Your alerts will persist during your browser session.

### Issue: "Can't Access via WiFi"
**Solutions:**
1. Check firewall settings
2. Ensure same WiFi network
3. Use the IP address shown in startup script
4. Try different ports (8502, 8503, etc.)

### Issue: "Port Already in Use"
**Solutions:**
1. The startup script automatically finds available ports
2. Manually try: `streamlit run app.py --server.port 8502`
3. Close other applications using port 8501

### Issue: "Dependencies Missing"
**Solution:**
```bash
pip install streamlit pandas numpy plotly scikit-learn xgboost lightgbm
```
