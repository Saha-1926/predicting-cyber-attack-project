# ✅ Corrected Cybersecurity Alert System Workflow

## 🎯 **You Were Right!**

Thank you for the correction! The alert creation functionality has been **properly moved** to the **Incident Response & Reporting** system where it belongs.

## 🔄 **New Correct Workflow:**

### **Step 1: Report Incidents** 📋
- **Location:** `📋 Incident Response & Reporting`
- **Action:** Fill out the comprehensive incident report form
- **Result:** Creates both an incident record AND a corresponding alert

### **Step 2: Monitor Alerts** 🚨  
- **Location:** `🔴 Real-Time Threat Monitoring` → `Alert Management`
- **Action:** View, filter, and manage alerts created from incidents
- **Result:** Track alert status and resolution

### **Step 3: Track Progress** 📈
